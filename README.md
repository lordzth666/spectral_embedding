Weighted spectral embedding of graphs

This repository contains the implementation in Python of weighted spectral embedding, as described in the paper:

Weighted spectral embedding of graphs, by Thomas Bonald, Alexandre Hollocou, Marc Lelarge, Allerton 2018.


## Getting started

```python
from spectral_embedding import *
```

Import a toy graph:

```python
import networkx as nx

graph = nx.karate_club_graph()
adjacency = nx.to_scipy_sparse_matrix(graph)
```

Spectral embedding

```python
eigen_val, eigen_vec, embedding = spectral_embedding(adjacency)
```
